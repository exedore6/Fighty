Fighty - a google wave battlemat gadget

A running version is hosted at http://www.savevsgeek.com/fighty

Fighty is a battlemap gadget for Google Wave, intended for using Wave for gaming.

Here’s what it does:

Takes a custom map from maplib.net
Presents that in a wave
Allows users to pan and zoom, synced with that gadget instance.
Allows users to add, and move markers
It’s still in developement, so it’s not quite complete for what I want, but here’s how to use it today.

Setup an account at http://www.maplib.net, upload your map.
Take the id for your map (e.g. http://www.maplib.net/map.php?id=xxx) where xxx is your map id
Add the gadget to your wave: http://www.savevsgeek.com/fighty.php?id=xxx where xxx is your map id
